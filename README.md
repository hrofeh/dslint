DSLint
============

A lightweight Android linter for Kotlin DSL aimed to solve the problem of verifying mandatory DSL attributes at compile time.
---

Usage
---

```kotlin
@DSLint
interface SomeDSLApi {

	@set:DSLMandatory(message = "ID please")
	var id: String

	@set:DSLMandatory(group = "name")
	var firstName: String

	@set:DSLMandatory(group = "name")
	var fullName: String

	var optional: String

	@DSLMandatory
	fun inner(block: SomeInnerDSLApi.() -> Unit)
}
```

Annotations
---

#### `@DSLint`

Use on a DSL class/interface that you want DSLint to verify.

#### `@DSLMandatory`

Use on mandatory DSL properties setters or functions.
Properties/functions annotated by this will generate a lint error if not
defined in the DSL lambda.

Grouping
---
Mandatory properties can be grouped together using the `group` attribute
in the `@DSLMandatory` annotation.
DSLint will verify that at least one of the properties in the group is defined.

```kotlin
@DSLint
interface SomeDSLApi {

	@set:DSLMandatory(group = "name")
	var firstName: String

	@set:DSLMandatory(group = "name")
	var fullName: String
}
```

Custom message
---
Custom error message can be defined using the `message` attribute in the `@DSLMandatory` annotation.
A custom message for grouped properties should be defined on the first property of the group.

```kotlin
@DSLint
interface SomeDSLApi {

	@set:DSLMandatory(message = "ID please")
	var id: String
}
```

Requirements
--------
DSLint will always show errors inside Android Studio.
In order for DSLint to also work on the gradle lint task (for release builds) the following conditions must be met:
Gradle version >= 6.3
Android Gradle Plugin >= 4.0.1

Download
--------

#### For app developers

```groovy
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.hananrh.dslint:dslint:1.1.1'
}
```

#### For SDK developers (DSLint linter will run on the app dependant on the SDK)

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.hananrh.dslint:dslint-annotations:1.1.1'
    lintPublish 'com.github.hananrh.dslint:dslint-checks:1.1.1'
